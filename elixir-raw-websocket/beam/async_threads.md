# Async Threads in the BEAM VM (`+A` flag)

## What is the `+A` Flag?
The `+A` flag in the BEAM VM sets the number of asynchronous threads used for handling file I/O, DNS lookups, and other blocking operations. These threads allow the VM to offload blocking tasks from schedulers, improving responsiveness and throughput.

## Why is it Needed?
BEAM schedulers are designed for lightweight, non-blocking processes. Blocking operations (like file reads) can stall a scheduler. Async threads handle these operations in the background, so the VM can continue processing other tasks.


## Example Usage
```sh
iex --erl "+A 1024" -S mix run --no-halt
```
- `+A 1024` sets 1024 async threads.

## Sample Elixir Code
Here's a simple example that triggers async file I/O. Try with different `+A` values:

```elixir
defmodule AsyncIODemo do
	def run(n) do
		tasks = for i <- 1..n do
			Task.async(fn -> File.read("/dev/urandom") end)
		end
		Enum.each(tasks, &Task.await(&1, 5000))
	end
end

# Run with:
# AsyncIODemo.run(100)
```

## Diagram: Async Thread Pool

```
BEAM Scheduler
		|
		|--[Async Task]---> [Async Thread 1]
		|--[Async Task]---> [Async Thread 2]
		|-- ...
		|--[Async Task]---> [Async Thread N]
```

More async threads allow more concurrent blocking I/O operations without blocking schedulers.

## When to Tune?
- Increase for heavy file I/O or DNS workloads.
- Too many threads can increase memory usage and context switching.
- For most web apps, 10â€“100 is enough; for massive I/O, use higher values.

## Drawbacks
- Higher values use more memory.
- Too many threads can reduce performance due to context switching.

## Summary
- Use `+A` to tune async thread pool size for blocking I/O.
- Find a balance based on your workload and hardware.
